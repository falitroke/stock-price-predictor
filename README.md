# Stock Price Predictor

![Build Status](https://github.com/rafael-fuentes/stock-price-predictor/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)
![Code Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-90%25-green)
![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-blue)

A machine learning tool to predict stock prices using historical data and LSTM models, with visualizations.

## Project Overview
Stock Price Predictor fetches historical stock data from Yahoo Finance, processes it through an ETL pipeline, trains an LSTM model using TensorFlow, and visualizes predictions with Matplotlib. This project showcases advanced Python skills in data science, automation, and machine learning, making it ideal for roles like Software Engineer or Data Scientist.

Key features:
- ETL pipeline for fetching and cleaning stock data
- LSTM-based machine learning model for price prediction
- Interactive visualizations saved as PNG
- Command-line interface for flexibility

## Installation Guide
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Docker (optional for containerized deployment)

### Setup
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rafael-fuentes/stock-price-predictor.git
   cd stock-price-predictor
Install dependencies:
bash
Ajuste
Copiar
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the predictor:
bash
Ajuste
Copiar
python src/cli.py --ticker AAPL --start 2023-01-01 --end 2025-02-28
Usage Examples
Basic Prediction
Run the default prediction for Apple stock:

bash
Ajuste
Copiar
python src/cli.py
Output: Prediction graph saved as docs/prediction.png.

Custom Prediction
Predict Tesla stock prices with custom parameters:

bash
Ajuste
Copiar
python src/cli.py --ticker TSLA --start 2024-01-01 --end 2025-02-28 --look-back 30 --epochs 20
Docker Usage
Build and run in Docker:

bash
Ajuste
Copiar
docker build -t stock-price-predictor .
docker run stock-price-predictor
CLI Documentation
The command-line interface (cli.py) accepts the following arguments:

--ticker: Stock ticker symbol (default: AAPL)
--start: Start date (YYYY-MM-DD, default: 2023-01-01)
--end: End date (YYYY-MM-DD, default: 2025-02-28)
--look-back: Number of days to look back (default: 60)
--epochs: Number of training epochs (default: 10)
Example:

bash
Ajuste
Copiar
python src/cli.py --ticker MSFT --look-back 90
Tutorial: Predicting Stock Prices
Running Locally
Install dependencies as above.
Run the CLI with your desired ticker:
bash
Ajuste
Copiar
python src/cli.py --ticker GOOGL
Check docs/prediction.png for the visualization.
Interpreting Results
The graph shows actual prices (blue) vs. predicted prices (orange).
Predictions are based on the last look-back days of data.
Deployment
AWS: Use the CI/CD pipeline to push to an ECR repository (replace <your-aws-ecr-repo> in ci.yml).
Local Docker: See Docker usage above.
Contributing Guidelines
Fork the repository and create a branch:
bash
Ajuste
Copiar
git checkout -b feature/add-new-feature
Code Standards:
Follow PEP8 (use flake8 for linting).
Testing:
Add tests in tests/ using pytest.
Run pytest --cov=src to ensure ≥85% coverage.
Commit and Push:
Use descriptive commits (e.g., feat: add CLI option for model save).
Push: git push origin feature/add-new-feature.
Submit a Pull Request:
Describe changes and ensure CI passes.
CI/CD Pipeline
Runs tests and builds a Docker image on push/PR to main.
Deploys to AWS ECR if configured (set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY in GitHub Secrets).

### Deployment Instructions
1. **Local Testing**: Run `python src/cli.py` to generate predictions.
2. **Docker**: Use `docker build` and `docker run` as shown in the README.
3. **AWS**: Configure an ECR repository, update `ci.yml` with your repo URL, and set AWS credentials in GitHub Secrets.

### Notes
- **Quality Standards**: Includes unit tests with good coverage, detailed documentation, and a CI/CD pipeline.
- **Output**: The `docs/prediction.png` file will be generated after running the predictor (ensure `docs/` exists).
- **Extensibility**: Add model saving (`model.save()`), more features (e.g., multiple tickers), or interactive plots if desired.
